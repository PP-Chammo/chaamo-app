# Chaamo App

A modern, modular, and scalable mobile app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev), following the [Atomic Design Pattern](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) for UI components.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Chaamo is a feature-rich mobile application designed for seamless user experience and maintainable code. It leverages Expo, React Native, and a modular component architecture to deliver a robust and extensible platform.

---

## ✨ Features

- Atomic Design: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms for reusable UI
- File-based routing with Expo Router
- State management with Zustand
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Modular, scalable folder structure
- Ready for CI/CD and code quality automation

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React Native** (0.79.4) & **Expo** (53.x)
- **TypeScript**
- **Zustand** (state management)
- **Tailwind CSS** (via NativeWind)
- **Expo Router** (file-based navigation)
- **Jest** (recommended for testing)
- **ESLint** & **Prettier** (linting/formatting)

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `app/` — Screens, navigation, and routing
- `components/`
  - `atoms/` — Smallest UI elements (Button, Icon, etc.)
  - `molecules/` — Combinations of atoms (Card, InputGroup, etc.)
  - `organisms/` — Complex UI sections (Lists, Forms, etc.)
- `constants/` — App-wide constants
- `domains/` — Type definitions and domain models
- `hooks/` — Custom React hooks
- `stores/` — Zustand stores for state management
- `utils/` — Utility functions
- `assets/` — Images, fonts, SVGs
- `scripts/` — Project scripts (e.g., reset-project)
- `types/` — Shared and generated types
  - `database.ts` — **Generated file.** Strict types for all tables, rows, inserts, and updates in your Supabase database. Generated by `yarn codegen`. **Do not edit manually.**

---

## ⚡ Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   # or
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the app**
   ```bash
   yarn start
   # or
   npx expo start
   ```
3. **Open in simulator or device**
   - Android: `yarn android`
   - iOS: `yarn ios`
   - Web: `yarn web`

---

## 📝 Scripts

- `yarn start` — Start Expo development server
- `yarn reset-project` — Reset app to blank state
- `yarn android` — Run on Android device/emulator
- `yarn ios` — Run on iOS device/emulator (with cache clear)
- `yarn web` — Run on web
- `yarn lint` — Run ESLint (max-warnings=0)
- `yarn lint:fix` — Auto-fix lint issues
- `yarn prettier` — Check code formatting
- `yarn prettier:fix` — Auto-format code
- `yarn typecheck` — TypeScript type check (no emit)
- `yarn test` — Run all tests with Jest
- `yarn test:watch` — Run tests in watch mode
- `yarn test:coverage` — Run tests with coverage
- `yarn test:ci` — Run tests in CI mode (bail on first failure)
- `yarn precheck` — Lint, format, and typecheck (for pre-commit or CI)
- `yarn prepare` — Husky prepare hook
- `yarn fix` — Run lint:fix and prettier:fix
- `yarn codegen` — Generate strict TypeScript types for your Supabase database schema. This command runs:

  ```bash
  npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id '<your-project-id>' --schema public > types/database.ts
  ```

  This will (re)generate the `types/database.ts` file from your Supabase project. **Do not edit this file manually.**

---

## 🧩 Components & Screens

- **Atoms:** Avatar, Badge, Button, Icon, Label, Tag, etc.
- **Molecules:** AuctionCard, CardItem, Category, Checkbox, OtpInput, People, etc.
- **Organisms:** AuctionList, CategoryList, FeaturedList, PeopleList, PortfolioProfile, etc.
- **Screens:** Auction Detail, Blocked Accounts, Categories, Portfolio Value, Search, Product List, Public Profile, Settings, Onboarding, etc.

> See the `components/` and `app/screens/` folders for full lists and code.

---

## 🗂️ State Management

- Uses [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction) for global state.
- Stores are in `stores/`.

---

## 🎨 Styling

- Utility-first styling with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) via [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/).
- Global styles in `global.css`.

---

## 🧪 Linting, Formatting & Testing

### Linting & Formatting

- **Lint:** `yarn lint` (auto-fix: `yarn lint:fix`)
- **Format:** `yarn prettier` (auto-fix: `yarn prettier:fix`)
- **Type Check:** `yarn tsc`

### Testing

Unit tests are already set up using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Native Testing Library](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/). All required dependencies are pre-installed and configured.

#### How to Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests in watch mode
yarn test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
yarn test:coverage
```

- Test files are located in `__tests__` folders next to their respective modules (e.g., `components/atoms/__tests__/Button.test.tsx`, `hooks/__tests__/useAuthStore.test.ts`).
- Coverage thresholds are enforced at 90% for branches, functions, lines, and statements (see `jest.config.js`).
- The test structure covers components, hooks, utils, and stores, with a focus on behavior, edge cases, and error handling.
- For advanced patterns, troubleshooting, and best practices, see [TESTING_GUIDE.md](./TESTING_GUIDE.md).

#### Example Test

```typescript
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import Button from '../../../components/atoms/Button';

describe('Button', () => {
  it('renders correctly with title', () => {
    const { getByText } = render(<Button title="Test Button" />);
    expect(getByText('Test Button')).toBeTruthy();
  });

  it('calls onPress when pressed', () => {
    const onPress = jest.fn();
    const { getByText } = render(
      <Button title="Test Button" onPress={onPress} />
    );
    fireEvent.press(getByText('Test Button'));
    expect(onPress).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });
});
```

#### Testing Best Practices

- Test behavior, not implementation
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error states and edge cases
- Keep tests simple and focused
